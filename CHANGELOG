Project Fingerprint GUI
=======================

version 1.05 (2013-05-08):
Workarounds:
- loader for UPEK devices is aware of the vendorId/productId now:
  productId < 0x2000 loads bsapi version 4.0
  productId >= 0x2000 loads bsapi version 4.3
Bugfixes:
- fixed: Segfault when stopping libfprint device asynchronous
Improvements:
- new usb.ids file (Version: 2013.05.08)
- tested on Ubuntu 13.04

version 1.05 (pre3):
Workarounds:
- unity-greeter calls pam_sm_authenticate twice for login (Ubuntu 12.10)
  and kills the first instance immediately. So we wait for one second
  to be killed until we go ahead with authentication.
- missing environment variable DISPLAY in unity-greeter, 
  so fingerprint-helper is not shown (Ubuntu 12.10). DISPLAY is set
  before fingerprint-helper is forked.
- unity-greeter releases the keyboard focus when fingerprint-helper
  is started. So noone can invoke a password while fingerprint-helper
  waits for finger-swipes. We search for unity-greeters window-id and
  push the keyboard focus back to it.
Bugfixes:
- fixed: Deadlock when reading /etc/mtab on systems where /etc/mtab is a symlink
- fixed: Permission problem with uinput for sudo in secure tty
- fixed: Compiler errors since ubuntu 12.10
- fixed: Some wrong include directives for qt4 headers
Improvements:
- new usb.ids file (Version: 2013.01.16)
- tested on Ubuntu 13.04 Beta1

version 1.04 (2012-03-11):
CHANGES:
Bugfixes:
- fixed: When running PAM-service "sudo" in a GUI environment the
	fingerprint-helper is started with privilegs of the calling
	user now. This avoids Gtk error messages about running a 
	GUI process as suid root.
- fixed: After lightdm bug #862559 since its version 1.1.4 has been
	fixed, pam_fingerprint-gui.so didn't start fingerprint-helper
	gui any more due to a bug in the workaround needed for
	lightdm versions below 1.1.4 (Ubuntu 11.10).
- fixed: Segfault in DeviceHandler.cpp with newer glibc.

version 1.03 (2011-12-07):
CHANGES:
Bugfixes:
- fixed: fingerprint-polkit-agent doesn't start on Lubuntu 11.10;
- fixed: No fingerprint login on secure tty (Ubuntu 11.10);
- fixed: X-server doesn't restart on logout (Ubuntu 11.10);
- fixed: Error message doesn't show up, when user's homedir is
        encrypted and fingerprint login was without password.

version 1.02 (2011-10-23):
CHANGES:
Minor bugfix: Segfault in fingerprint-polkit-agent fixed.

version 1.01 (2011-10-15):
CHANGES (needed for Ubuntu 11.10):
- workaround for bug #862559 (lightdm): Display ":0" hard coded for service
  lightdm in pam_fingerprint-gui.so
Minor bugfixes:
- inserted missing "Unity" entry in /etc/xdg/autostart/fingerprint-polkit-agent.desktop
- fixed: disabled password dialog in polkit agent, when more than one administrator user
  is available.

version 1.00 (2010-12-13):
CHANGES:
- fingerprint-polkit-agent builds by default on systems with libpolkit-qt-1-0.
  For systems with libpolkit-qt-1-1 (Natty) qmake must be called with the extra
  argument LIBPOLKIT_QT=LIBPOLKIT_QT_1_1.
- The default PREFIX for building and installing was changed from "/usr"
  to "/usr/local".
- System is bundled with UPEK libbsapi "BSAPI_4.0.0218Lite_RC_for_Linux"
  supporting a larger number of UPEK device.
Minor bugfixes:
- pam_fingerprint-gui.so fixed for systems without XAuth variable in GDM 
  environment (Gentoo);

version 1.00-rc3 (2010-11-19):
Additional library required: libpolkit-qt-1
CHANGES:
- Authenticating root in console, gnome-terminal and xterm for "su" works now
  without gui widget;
- A new module "fingerprint-polkit-agent" has been added. It enables fingerprint
  authentication for the PAM service "polkit-1". The agent needs to be started
  at system startup. Therefore the file "fingerprint-polkit-agent.desktop" is
  installed to /etc/xdg/autostart. This agent conflicts with files in
  /etc/xdg/autostart that must be removed:
  "polkit-gnome-authentication-agent-1.desktop" and
  "polkit-kde-authentication-agent-1.desktop".
- New "help" menu in fingerprint-gui. "Help" opens a "Fingerprint GUI Manual" in
  default browser. If available the manual is opened in the users local language
  (See "Manual_??.html" files in /usr/share/doc/fingerprint-gui).
- "sudo make install-upek" installs a new libbsapi.so named
  "BSAPI 4.0 for Linux Unqualified Preview". This lib can handle 147e:1000 devices
  with NVM emulation now. It will be upgraded as soon a final version is available.
- Default settings for NVM emulation are installed in "/etc/upek.cfg" and a
  directory "/var/upek_data" is created.
- Bugfix: Test button is disabled while a test is running; no segfault any more.

version 1.00-rc2 (2010-10-30):
CHANGES:
- IPC between pam_fingerprint-gui.so and fingerprint-helper has been changed
  from using libfakekey/uinput to using a pipe (for sending random number,
  password and username). This should make the system independent from keymaps.
  Only <enter> is sent to the pam prompt by libfakekey or uinput now.
- new argument for pam_fingerprint-gui.so "try_first_identified"
  This option avoids a finger-swipe to be requested twice if the PAM stack calls
  pam_fingerprint-gui.so more then once. Example for gdm login with disabled 
  user browser:

  File "/etc/pam.d/gdm":
  ...
  auth optional pam_fingerprint-gui.so -d  #required to get the username for nologin
  auth requisite pam_nologin.so
  ...
  @include common-auth
  ...

  File "/etc/pam.d/common-auth":
  ...
  auth [success=3 default=ignore] pam_fingerprint-gui.so try_first_identified -d
  ...

  The second call to pam_fingerprint-gui.so returns PAM_SUCCESS if the user was
  identified by fingerprint in the first call from file "/etc/pam.d/gdm".


version 1.00-rc1 (2010-10-16):
CHANGES: Some minor gui improvements like follows:
- In the "Finger" tab fingers with already existing bir data are marked
  green.
- In the "Password" tab the path to the external media for saving the
  encrypted password is predefined in the "Save to Directory" field when
  a password was saved there before and this media is connected.
BUGFIXES:
- Gnome-screensaver hangs while unlocking -- fixed
- Logout hangs after fingerprint login -- fixed
- Applications using polkit-1 can not be unlocked -- fixed (but fingerprints
  are ignored; a password is required)
- Usernames with more than 8 characters don't work -- fixed
- "su" doesn't work in gnome-terminal -- _not_ fixed (as a workaround
  "sudo su" can be used)

version 0.15 (2010-08-20):
CHANGES: Some minor bugfixes like follows:
- Environment variables like username or hostname are requested by a
  posix compliant system call now;
- The uinput driver module is loaded on-the-fly when needed.
- libbsapi is now installed to /usr/lib (on 32bit systems) 
  or /usr/lib64 (on 64bit systems);
- The file locations are changed to fit the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard:
  Helper programs that should not be called by the user are located in
  "/usr/local/lib/fingerprint-gui/" now.
!!!PLEASE UNINSTALL A PREVIOUS VERSION BEFORE INSTALLING THIS ONE!!!


version 0.14 (2010-05-14):
CHANGES: Some minor bugfixes for running on Fedora 12 like follows:
- libbsapi is now installed to /usr/lib
- A bug in selecting the current fingerprint device (with more than one devices
  available on the system) was fixed.
- A minor bug in FingerprintPAM (login with given PAM_RHOST) has been fixed.
- A script to disable the user list in gdm was added.
- The install script installs required rules files to /etc/udev/rules.d/ now
  when libbsapi.so is installed.
- The install script creates a /etc/upek.cfg file and a /var/upek_data directory
  when libbsapi.so is installed.
- The Install-step-by-step.pdf manual has been adapted to Fedora12, Kubuntu 10.04
  and Lubuntu 10.04.
- The whole system requires "libfprint-0.1.0" and "libusb-1.0.0" now. Please
  upgrade your libfprint (see Ubuntu-upgrade-libfprint.sh)!!


version 0.13 (2010-04-21):
IMPORTANT: Fingerprint data (bir) and configuration files (config.xml) located
in "~/.fingerprints/...", that are created by a previous version, can _not_ be
used any more! All user-specific data and configuration has to be newly setup!
The entry "/usr/local/bin/fingerprintPlugin -d" made with gconf-editor for
the gnome-screensaver, that was created for a previous version, has to be changed
to "/usr/local/bin/fingerprint-plugin -d".
All entries for fingerprint in PAM configuration files (/etc/pam.d/...) have to
be renamed from "libpam_fingerprint.so" to "pam_fingerprint-gui.so".
For more information about upgrading please read IMPORTANT-UPGRADE-INFORMATION.txt.

CHANGES: Lots of code cleanup and CONFIGURATION CHANGES:
- Executables have been renamed to "fingerprint-gui", "fingerprint-helper",
  "fingerprint-identifier", "fingerprint-plugin" and "pam_fingerprint-gui.so".
- A new executable "fingerprint-suid" has been added. It is called from
  fingerprint-gui and creates subdirectories for user's bir-data with proper
  directory- and file mode.
- Fingerprints and user configurations are NOT stored to the user's home directory
  any more! They are stored to a new directory /var/lib/fingerprint-gui/<user>/ now.
  (This makes it possible to login for users with an encrypted home directory,
  when an external media with stored encrypted password is available).
- Subdirectories for fingerprint data of different drivers are now named after
  the driver name.
- A wrapper for proprietary device drivers is now used for those devices.
- Proprietary driver libraries are now dynamically loaded at runtime. Different
  executables (linked to proprietary drivers) are not needed any more.
- A preliminary mechanism is used for identifying an unmounted encrypted homedir
  of the identified user:
  - if the homedir is empty, it is assumed to be encrypted and unmounted;
  - if it is not empty _and_ a file "README.TXT" exists _and_ this file is a
    symlink _and_ this symlink points to a path that contains a string
    "ecryptfs-utils" in pathname, the homedir is assumed to be encrypted and
    unmounted.
  In case the homedir of the identified user is encrypted and unmounted _and_
  an external media containing the users password can not be found, the login
  with fingerprint is stopped and an error message
  "!!!ERROR: FOUND ENCRYPTED HOMEDIR BUT NO PASSWORD!!!"
  is given via PAM conversation. This protects the user from being logged-in
  into a session with unmounted homedir.
  Maybe I find a more elegant procedure for detecting an encrypted and unmounted
  homedir in a later version. Suggestions welcome!


version 0.12 (2009-10-23):
- "with-upek" binaries are linked against UPEKs libbsapi version 3.6 now.
- libbsapi is now availbale as 32bit and 64bit version (install.sh).
- changed displaying behaviour of fingerprint icons while acquire to support
  more than 5 required swipes.


version 0.11 (2009-07-15):
- new feature "Save encrypted password to removable media".


version 0.10 (2009-05-13):
- fixed: GDM login on Ubuntu 9.04 didn't work.


version 0.9 (2009-02-23):
- fixed: Identifying didn't work with some libfprint drivers on 64bit systems.
- new: "configure.sh" script that creates makefiles for 32bit and 64bit.
- new: Precompiled 64bit and 32bit binaries for all modules.
- new: Installation script "install.sh" can now install on 32bit and 64bit
  systems with "--fprin-only" and "--with-upek" arguments. It makes use of
  "getlibs" to overcome the limitation that results from "libbsapi" being 32bit
  only for UPEK devices.


version 0.8 (2009-02-05):
- fixed: Ignoring users with empty "gecos" field in /etc/passwd


version 0.7 (2009-01-29):
- fixed: "Abnormal Program Termination" when called from KDM;

- complete new designed libpam_fingerprint.so (see Hacking.pdf);
- new module "fingerprintPlugin" to beused with gnome-screensaver;
- "Install-step-by-step" tutorial enhanced for Fedora 10;
- new "Hacking" tutorial.


version 0.5 (2008-10-27):
- fixed: Segfault in Identifier and PAM when no fingerprint devices are available;
- fixed: Segfault in GUI when more than one fingerprint device is connected;
- removed: Blacklist for services in fingerprintPAM.cpp.
- added: Error messages to stderr when no devices or fingerprints are available
    for fingerprintIdentifier;
- added: Error message in Identifier when fingerprint device could not opened.
- added: "Test" button for important PAM services in fingerprintGUI.
- added: "Ubuntu Step by Step" configuration tutorial.
- tested with standalone device HP Compaq SK-3350 (AuthenTec AES2501A). 


version 0.4 (2008-10-09):
- fingerprintIdentifier returns login name of the identified user now,
  (to be used in scripts or other programs);
- fingerprintPAM can identify users while login before promting for username,
  (the former planned fingerprintLogin module is no longer needed);
- target of fingerprintPAM library was renamed to "libpam_fingerprint.so";
- changed layouts and window decorations;
- login tested on Ubuntu 8.04 and SuSE 11.0 (with gdm);
- directory structure and makefiles are changed to build "with-upek" and
  "fprint-only" versions of all targets now.


version 0.3 (2008-09-20):
- lots of code cleanup,
- many bugs fixed (compiles and runs now with undefined "HAS_LIBBSAPI"),
- tested on SuSE 11.0 with KDE 3.5.


version 0.2 (2008-08-29):
- added module fingerprintPAM (libfingerprintPAM.so) for using with PAM authentication.
Known issues:
- doesn't show the gui when called from "gksu" or "gnome-screensaver",
    ATTENTION: TEST CAREFULLY! Configure pam to use it with
    "gnome-screensaver" only if you know what you are doing. It can make your
    system unaccessible!
- doesn't authenticate "seahorse" with login (I don't know why yet);
- ONLY TESTED ON Ubuntu 8.04 with UPEK built-in TouchStrip on an IBM R52


version 0.1 (2008-08-22):
Initial version for testing and proof of concept only, containing
fingerprintGUI and fingerprintIdentifier
